TextGlass Reference Client


[Internal TODO]
-combine loadPattern and loadFile into 1 load with state
-fix attribute json to be an object


WHAT IS THIS?
=============

This is the reference client for the TextGlass project.

This reference client is the starting point for:

 * Creating, testing, and validating a TextGlass domain.

 * Creating a TextGlass client for a specific platform or language.

SOURCE
======

[source url here]

The source is broken up into several components:

 * src/Main.java
    This is the driver for the reference client. It contains logic to parse
    the command line and the test file.

 * src/TextGlassClient.java
    This is the actual TextGlass client. It is initialized with a pattern file
    and an attribute file (or multiple). Once initialized, it can then classify
    text and return back attribute maps.

 * src/JsonFile.java
    This parses a JSON file into something the TextGlassClient can handle.

 * src/Pattern.java
    This is a pattern object.

 * src/Attributes.java
    This is the pattern attributes object.

 * src/Transformer*.java
    These are transformers.


COMPILE
=======

Note: this step requires "javac" (JDK)

./compile.sh

To clean:

./compile.sh clean


RUN
===

Note: this step requires "java" (JRE)

./run.sh -p [pattern file] -a [attribute file] -t [test file]

For help:

./run.sh -h

To run the reference_a domain:

./run.sh \
  -p ../domains/a/patterns.json \
  -a ../domains/a/attributes.json \
  -t ../domains/a/test.json

You can also use the test harness:

./test.sh ../domains/a
